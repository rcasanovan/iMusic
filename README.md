## How did I implement VIPER?

Basically I have a protocol file for each scene in the app. This file defines the interaction between each layer as following:

* View - Presenter: protocols to notify changes and to inject information to the UI.
* Presenter - Interactor: protocols to request / receive information to / from the interactor.
* Presenter - Router: protocol to define the transitions between scenes.

Whith this protocols file is really easy to know how each layer notify / request / information to the other ones so we don't have any other way to communicate all the layers.

Another important point is because I'm using protocols it's really easy to define mocks views / presenters / interactors / routers for testing.

```swift
// View / Presenter
protocol SearchListViewInjection : class {
    func showProgress(_ show: Bool, status: String)
    func showProgress(_ show: Bool)
    func showMessageWith(title: String, message: String, actionTitle: String)
    func loadTracks(_ viewModels: [TrackViewModel], fromBeginning: Bool)
    func loadSuggestions(_ suggestions: [SuggestionViewModel])
}

protocol SearchListPresenterDelegate : class {
    func viewDidLoad()
    func searchTrack(_ search: String?)
    func trackSelectedAt(section: Int, index: Int)
    func getSuggestions()
    func suggestionSelectedAt(_ index: Int)
    func sortTracksBy(_ type: SortType)
}

// Presenter / Interactor

typealias TracksGetTracksCompletionBlock = (_ viewModel: [TrackViewModel]?, _ success: Bool, _ error: ResultError?) -> Void
typealias TrackListGetSuggestionsCompletionBlock = ([SuggestionViewModel]) -> Void

protocol SearchListInteractorDelegate : class {
    func getTracksList(search: String?, completion: @escaping TracksGetTracksCompletionBlock)
    func clear()
    func getTrackSelectedAt(_ index: Int) -> TrackViewModel?
    func getAllSuggestions(completion: @escaping TrackListGetSuggestionsCompletionBlock)
    func getSuggestionAt(index: Int) -> SuggestionViewModel?
    func getInitialSearch() -> String
    func sortTracksBy(_ sortType: SortType)
    func getLocalTracks() -> [TrackViewModel]
}

// Presenter / Router
protocol SearchListRouterDelegate : class {
    func showTrackDetail(_ track: TrackViewModel, allTracks: [TrackViewModel])
}
```
